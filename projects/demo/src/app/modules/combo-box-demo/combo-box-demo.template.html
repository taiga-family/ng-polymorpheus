    <strong>Important note:</strong>
    while
    <code><strong>ng-template</strong></code>
    works just fine in most cases — it follows change detection of the view where it was
    <strong>defined</strong>
    not where it was
    <strong>instantiated</strong>
    . Therefore, if you pass it up along (or parallel) the view tree — changes initiated inside template might not
    propagate as expected. You can use
    <code><strong>polymorpheus</strong></code>
    directive to get around this issue:
    <pre><code highlight="<ng-template #ref=&quot;polymorpheus&quot; polymorpheus>...</ng-template>"></code></pre>
    All this directive does is store reference to
    <code><strong>ChangeDetectorRef</strong></code>
    of definition view so it can mark it for changes when needed. Don't forget to import
    <code><strong>PolymorpheusTemplate.</strong></code>
